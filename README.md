# Prelude Code of Conduct

This code of conduct is a living document. As we grow and learn this is likely to change.

## Who is this for?

Prelude offers high-quality software development training and mentorship, with a focus on Python and Django. You can learn more [here](https://prelude.tech/).

This code of conduct must be followed by:

- All teaching staff
- All student support staff
- All students/learners 

We are dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free learning environment for everyone. We want all our learners and teachers to flourish. We recognize that there will be differences in opinions, but we strive to overcome those differences with grace.

- We are all here to grow so that we can better help others to grow
- If you and I disagree then it doesn't mean it's you versus me, a disagreement is an opportunity to get closer to the truth. Curiosity will help everyone win

To make clear what is expected, all members are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct:

## Our Interactions

We aim to maintain a sense of community, connection and mutual support in any training we run.

Everyone taking part in our training is open, considerate, and respectful. Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

- Fostering curiosity: in ourselves and each other
- Being open: Participants are open to collaboration.
- Focusing on what is best for the group as a whole: We’re respectful of the processes set forth, and we work within them.
- Showing empathy towards other participants: We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
- Being considerate: Participants are considerate of each other.
- Being respectful: We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We’re receptive to constructive comments and criticism
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism: When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language: We’re accepting of all who take part in our activities,

## Our Standards

Every participant has the right to have their identity respected. Prelude is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, cultural and cognitive variations, or socio-economic status.
